# JavaScript vs TypeScript Cheat Sheet

## JavaScript (JS)

- **Freedom:** Highly flexible, but can easily introduce bugs.
- **Loose Documentation:** JSDocs exist but are optional and often inconsistent.
- **Developer Tooling:** Autocomplete, refactoring, and error detection are weaker.
- **AI / Code Intelligence:** Harder for AI tools to analyze and assist.
- **Runtime:** Runs directly in browser or Node.js.

## TypeScript (TS)

- **Addon on JS:** Built on top of JavaScript.
- **Compilation:** TS code does not run directly. It is compiled to JS (`tsc`) before execution.
- **JS + Extra Features:** Adds static typing, interfaces, enums, generics, and utility types.
- **Features That Matter:**
  - ✅ **Type Checker:** Catches mistakes before runtime.
  - ✅ **Code Consistency:** Makes code predictable and maintainable.
  - ✅ **Better Tooling / AI Support:** IDEs and AI can read and understand TS code.
  - ✅ **Safer Scaling:** Ideal for large projects and team collaboration.
- **Runtime:** Eventually runs as JavaScript.

## Quick Mental Shortcut

- **JS =** Flexible, fast, chaotic
- **TS =** JS + Safety net + AI-readable + Industry-ready

## TL;DR

> TypeScript is nothing but JavaScript with types, discipline, and intelligence.
